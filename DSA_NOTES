the analysis of an algorithm performance is terms of time and space requirement as a function of input size

The space complexity total amount of memory required by an algorithm for its complete execution called space complexity
It is all so called known as constant space complexity constant space complexity meaning that always Define memory for any values of integer or any letter dice
